## Who I Think I Am
In terms of personality, I think the word "tolerant" suits me well. When facing various things, I am used to considering them from multiple perspectives and can understand the behaviors of different people. I also consider myself a kind person. I try to be gentle, but sometimes I can be quite irritable ??. Most of the time, I am optimistic and open-minded, though occasionally I can be a bit negative. Overall, I'd say I'm a "good person".

Regarding my attitude towards life, I hope to live a good life, strive to move forward, and see more different scenery, exploring the vast world ??.

## Current Career Development

Currently, I plan to start working after graduating from undergraduate studies. At the age of twenty, I have an idealized view of society. I'm eager to take risks and explore, looking forward to seeing a bigger world instead of just staying on campus. I also hope that in the future, no matter whether I am in a good or bad situation, I can always maintain a positive attitude ??.

## Some Quirky Hobbies
My main hobbies are watching anime, movies, and reading books:
- ?? **Anime**: I prefer daily-life and warm-hearted types. Life is tough, so it's nice to watch something happy to heal myself.
- ??? **Movies**: On one hand, I like animated movies, especially Chinese animated movies! On the other hand, I'm into comedy movies, and it would be even better if they have some elements of satire or profound meanings.
- ?? **Books**: I'm keen on history and literature. In terms of history, I used to focus on the Tang, Song, Wei, and Jin dynasties, and now I have a greater preference for modern history. In the field of literature, I like novels, such as *To Live*, *Wencheng*, and *Animal Farm*.

In addition, I'm also interested in sports and games:
- ?? **Sports** (Trying hard to keep it up??): I used to run a lot, but I stopped after starting my internship. I'm trying to pick it up again. I can play a bit of badminton and billiards, not very well, but I enjoy it.
- ?? **Games**: I like casual games like *There Is a Home in the Depths of Taoyuan*, story-driven games like *The Moonlight Villa*, and tower defense games like *Arknights*.

That's all for now. I'll add more if I think of something later ?
